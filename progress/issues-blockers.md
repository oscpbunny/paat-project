## üîç **Troubleshooting Guidelines**

### **Before Reporting an Issue**
1. Check if the issue is already documented
2. Verify the issue is reproducible
3. Gather relevant error messages and logs
4. Note the system environment and conditions
5. Identify any workarounds or temporary solutions

### **Issue Investigation Process**
1. **Reproduce** the issue reliably
2. **Isolate** the root cause
3. **Research** similar issues and solutions
4. **Document** findings and attempts
5. **Implement** the fix
6. **Test** the resolution thoroughly
7. **Document** the solution for future reference

### **When to Escalate**
- Issue blocks critical milestone progress
- Multiple attempts to resolve have failed
- Issue affects system architecture decisions
- External dependency changes required
