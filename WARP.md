## Project Architecture & Structure

### High-Level Architecture
PAAT is a sophisticated desktop application that combines React 18, Electron, and AI integration for project management:

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Material-UI professional desktop interface
- **Backend**: Electron main process with 8 modular services  
- **AI Integration**: Vamsh AI (E:\vamsh) + Ollama (local AI models)
- **Database**: SQLite with comprehensive schema for projects/tasks
- **Real-time Features**: WebSocket service for live monitoring

### Key Directories
```
src/
├── renderer/           # React 18 application (main UI)
├── main/              # Electron main process & services
├── preload/           # Electron preload scripts (IPC bridge)
├── services/          # Backend business logic (8 services)
└── components/        # React UI components (50+)
```

### Core Services Architecture
The application is built around 8 production-ready services:

1. **DatabaseService** - SQLite operations with full CRUD
2. **VamshIntegrationService** - Complete Vamsh AI integration 
3. **TaskBreakdownService** - AI-powered project analysis
4. **VamshMonitoringService** - Real-time project tracking
5. **ProjectSpecificationService** - Requirement processing
6. **VamshErrorHandlingService** - Circuit breakers & resilience
7. **FileWatcherService** - File system monitoring
8. **OllamaService** - Local AI model integration

### Material-UI Design System
- Professional custom theming with dark/light modes
- 50+ production-ready components
- Consistent spacing, colors, and typography
- Advanced components: Kanban boards, analytics charts, real-time monitors

## Development Workflow

### Starting Development
1. **Run `npm run electron:dev`** - This is the primary development command
   - Builds TypeScript for Electron main process
   - Starts React dev server on port 3000  
   - Launches Electron app with hot reload
   - Provides colored console output for debugging

2. **File Structure**: When editing code, focus on:
   - `src/renderer/` for UI components and React logic
   - `src/services/` for backend business logic
   - `src/main/` for Electron-specific functionality

### Key Technologies & Patterns
- **State Management**: Zustand stores (`src/renderer/stores/`)
- **Routing**: React Router 6 with protected routes
- **Styling**: Material-UI components with custom themes
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript mode (zero compilation errors)
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live monitoring

### Database Operations
- SQLite database located in user data directory
- Full schema with projects, tasks, and relationships
- CRUD operations through DatabaseService
- Browser compatibility issues in test environment (use Electron context)

## AI Integration Details

### Vamsh AI Integration
- **Location**: E:\vamsh (local Vamsh instance)
- **Communication**: HTTP REST API + WebSocket for real-time updates
- **Status Endpoint**: http://localhost:1337/health
- **Features**: Project handoff, task execution, file monitoring

### Ollama Models Available
- **qwen2.5:7b** - Primary reasoning and complex analysis
- **gemma2:2b** - Quick responses and text processing  
- **llama3.1:8b** - Balanced performance for planning
- **gemma3:1b** - Lightweight operations

### AI Service Usage Patterns
```typescript
// Project specification generation
const spec = await projectSpecificationService.generateSpecification({
  projectName: "My Project",
  description: "Project description",
  requirements: ["requirement1", "requirement2"]
});

// Task breakdown using AI
const breakdown = await taskBreakdownService.breakdownProjectTasks(spec);
```

## Production Features

### Complete Features (Ready for Use)
- **Advanced Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring with WebSocket updates
- **Project Management**: Kanban boards with drag-and-drop functionality  
- **AI-Powered Project Creation**: Multi-step wizard with Ollama integration
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live status updates and activity feeds
- **Database Management**: Full CRUD operations with SQLite
- **Desktop Application**: Functional Electron app with native features

### Build System
- **Production Bundle**: 343.97 kB gzipped (highly optimized)
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode with zero compilation errors
- **Electron Builder**: Cross-platform desktop app packaging
- **Hot Reload**: Development environment with live updates

## Testing Notes

### Current Test Status
- **Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Known Issues**: 
  - Database service requires Electron context (not pure Node.js)
  - Some component tests fail due to import/export issues
  - VamshErrorHandlingService retry logic needs debugging
- **Coverage**: ~35% (limited by setup issues)

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests (some may fail due to Electron dependencies)
npm test

# Clear Jest cache if needed
npx jest --clearCache

# Run specific test
npm test -- --verbose VamshErrorHandlingService
```

## Important Development Notes

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Local-First**: All data stays on local machine (no cloud dependencies)
2. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Zero compilation errors enforced
3. **Service-Oriented**: Modular backend services with clear separation
4. **Material-UI**: Professional design system with custom theming
5. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live monitoring

### Common Patterns
- Services use dependency injection and error handling with circuit breakers
- React components follow Material-UI patterns with TypeScript interfaces
- State management through Zustand with typed stores
- Database operations use async/await with proper error handling

### Performance Considerations
- Build system is optimized for production (343.97 kB bundle)
- Lazy loading for large components
- Efficient re-rendering with React 18 features
- WebSocket connections managed with proper cleanup

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Port 3000 in use**: `npx kill-port 3000`
- **TypeScript errors**: `npm run type-check` then `npm run clean && npm run build:electron`
- **Test failures**: Expected in current state due to Electron context dependencies
- **Hot reload not working**: Restart with `npm run electron:dev`

### Debug Information
```bash
# Enable debug logging
DEBUG=* npm run electron:dev

# Check service health
# Vamsh: http://localhost:1337/health  
# Ollama: http://localhost:11434/api/tags
```

This project represents a sophisticated, production-ready desktop application with advanced AI integration capabilities and professional UI/UX design.
