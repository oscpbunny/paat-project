- **WebSocket** connections for real-time updates
- **Circuit Breaker** patterns for resilient communication
- **Retry Logic** with exponential backoff

### AI Integration Layer
```typescript
Ollama Models:
├── qwen2.5:7b    - Complex analysis and planning
├── gemma2:2b     - Quick analysis and responses  
├── llama3.1:8b   - Balanced performance
└── gemma3:1b     - Lightweight operations

Vamsh Integration:
├── HTTP Client   - RESTful API communication
├── WebSocket     - Real-time project monitoring
├── File Watcher  - Change detection and sync
└── Error Handler - Resilient failure recovery
```

## 🧪 Detailed Test Analysis

### Test Environment Setup
```json
{
  "framework": "Jest + React Testing Library",
  "coverage": "In Progress",
  "environment": "jsdom (browser simulation)",
  "mocking": "Manual mocks for external services",
  "ci_integration": "Not yet configured"
}
```

### Identified Test Issues

#### 1. VamshErrorHandlingService Retry Logic
**Issue:** Circuit breaker state management and retry counting inconsistencies
```javascript
// Problem: Retry logic not executing expected number of attempts
Expected: mockFn called 3 times
Actual: mockFn called 1 time
```

**Root Cause:** Event emission timing conflicts with retry execution
**Priority:** High - Core functionality for production stability

#### 2. Database Service Context Dependency
**Issue:** Cannot instantiate DatabaseService in pure Node.js test environment
```javascript
// Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getPath')
// at new DatabaseService (src/services/database.ts:83:30)
```

**Root Cause:** Dependency on Electron app.getPath() for database location
**Solution:** Create browser-compatible test doubles or run in Electron context

#### 3. React Component Import/Export Issues
**Issue:** Component routing failing due to undefined imports
```javascript
// Error: Element type is invalid - got undefined
// Check your code at MainContent.tsx:37
```

**Root Cause:** Circular dependencies or incorrect export patterns
**Impact:** App component tests failing, UI functionality unverified

### Test Coverage Goals
- **Target Coverage:** 80%+ for all services
- **Current Status:** ~35% (partial due to test setup issues)
- **Priority Focus:** Fix mocking infrastructure first
- **Integration Tests:** Need Electron test runner setup

## 🚀 Core Features Implemented

### 1. AI-Powered Project Creation Pipeline
```typescript
interface ProjectCreationFlow {
  step1: "Natural language requirements analysis"
  step2: "AI-generated project specification"  
  step3: "Intelligent task breakdown with dependencies"
  step4: "Realistic time estimation"
  step5: "Vamsh integration and handoff"
  step6: "Real-time monitoring setup"
}
```

**Status:** ✅ Complete backend, ⚠️ UI integration in progress

### 2. Real-Time Project Monitoring
