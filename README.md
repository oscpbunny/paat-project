## 🔧 Development Dependencies

- Node.js 18+ 
- TypeScript
- Electron
- React
- SQLite3
- Ollama (local AI models)
- Vamsh (E:\vamsh)

## 🧪 Testing Status

**Test Coverage Summary:**
- ✅ TaskBreakdownService: 14/14 tests passing (100%)
- ❌ VamshErrorHandlingService: 7/12 tests passing (retry logic issues)
- ❌ Database Service: Tests failing due to Electron app context
- ❌ VamshIntegrationService: Tests failing due to mocking issues
- ❌ React Components: useParams and component export issues

**Known Test Issues:**
- Circuit breaker retry logic needs refinement
